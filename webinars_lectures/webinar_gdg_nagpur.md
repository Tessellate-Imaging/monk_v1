## About the authors

### Abhishek Kumar Annamraju 
Abhishek’s research areas include computer vision, machine learning, natural language processing, and photogrammetry.
As a part of his undergraduate thesis and then continued employment at Tata Elxsi R&D, India, he worked on on-road real-time vehicle detection. He has published research papers on cascade classifiers, shape-based object analysis, and traffic sign classifier (IET Intelligent Transport Systems journal). His past projects include image-based monitoring solution to curb illegal sand mining, 3D facial model generation and classification, deep learning based face recognition, and camera auto-calibration for fisheye images (Tesseract Imaging, India). He was also a part of the Mahindra Rise Challenge 2014 and developed real-time stationary-cam object detection modules.
He participated in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2016, working with Open-Detection, to develop GUI-based deep learning training and classification system. His research work includes projects involving forensic sketch to image matching and biomedical image processing.
Abhishek got his B.E (Hons.) degree in Electrical and Electronics from from BITS Pilani, K.K. Birla Goa Campus.
